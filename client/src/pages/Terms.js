          you are at least 21 years old and that the person to whom the delivery
          will be made is at least 21 years old. All shipments require an adult

          be made to a business address.

          of purchase.

          EMAIL LIST: From time to time, we send out promotional emails. These
          emails are sent only to people who request to be on this email list
          and are never sent to anyone who did not voluntarily subscribe to the
          email list through our home page, or through our in-store systems. The
          information gathered through the email list signup is not used for any
          other purpose than sending promotional emails. Any person who has
          signed up or this service and wishes to be removed from the program
          can delete themselves using the “unsubscribe" link found in the
          promotional emails. We do not, under any circumstances, share any
          personally identifiable information about you with any other person,
          group, organization, or business entity.

          when you place an order. This information collection is meant to
          protect us as the merchant and you as the consumer from fraud. We also
          use this information to properly process your credit card offline,
          ship your order, and communicate with you regarding your order. The
          information is gathered and kept securely online, and is used for
          these purposes only. Your order information is kept securely in case
          of problems that may arise at a later date regarding your order.
