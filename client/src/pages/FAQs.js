          <h4>What Are Your Shipping & Delivery Practices?</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>All product is shipped at 56°.</strong> It&rsquo;s not just
            hype; it&rsquo;s what we do to guarantee quality. Every wine is
            shipped under perfect temperature-control. If you want to arrange a
            tour of our facility, BRING A JACKET! It&rsquo;s always 56°.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because wine is a perishable, we recommend against shipping wine
            during the months of May through October for temperature
            considerations. For orders under $200, shipping charges will be
            added to your order and will vary depending on your ship-to
            locations.
          </p>

          <p>
            We arrange for deliveries Monday through Friday. We cannot guarantee
            a precise date of delivery, but we will do our best to accommodate
            requests. Please call 888-DRINK-CWC for information on Saturday
            deliveries.
          </p>

          <p>
            Alcoholic beverages may be sold and delivered only to persons who
            are at least 21 years old. In placing your order, you represent to
            us that you are at least 21 years old and that the person to whom
            the delivery will be made is at least 21 years old. All shipments
            require an adult signature on receipt. Whenever possible, we
            recommend that shipments be made to a business address.

          <h4>What Are Your Return/Refund Policies?</h4>
          <p>
            Your satisfaction with California Wine Cooperative is extremely
            important, and we will make every effort to make sure you&rsquo;re
            happy with the wines you purchase from us. Because wine is a
            perishable product, there is no need for you to return it to us. All
            we ask is that you contact us directly by phone or email to initiate
            a refund.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once your refund request is received we will notify you of the
            approval or rejection of your refund. If you are approved, then your
            refund will be processed, and a credit will automatically be applied
            to your credit card or original method of payment, within two days.
            We will send all confirming information to you regarding the date
            the refund was issued, as well as copies of receipts whether by mail
            or email, whichever is most convenient to you.
