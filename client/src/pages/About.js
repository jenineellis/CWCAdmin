            California Wine Cooperative is unique. In 2019, students in a Web
            Development Bootcamp — Matthew Heimark, Avid Wine Appreciator, after
            years of living in the the northern Bay Area; Madeleine Kemeny, a
            former Pastry Chef and General Snob with a parent living in the
            Russian River Valley and across the road from multiple vineyards;
            Marta Tomaras, an Experienced Wine Fan, who grew up with
            grandparents making their own wine; and Jenine Ellis — developed a
            concept to introduce lesser known and smaller batch producing
            vineyards to discerning wine consumers whose local shops, outside of
            California, might not represent these wonderful products.

            We showcase the work of winegrowers committed to natural farming,
            small production, and the traditions of their respective regions.
            Many of the producers we represent are considered among the finest
            in the world. Through our personal relationship with these small
            family farms, the wines come directly from the cellars under perfect
            temperature controlled systems. We are privileged to share these
            beautiful wines and invite you to join this wonderful community of
            winegrowers and wine lovers.
