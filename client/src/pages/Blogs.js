            Alder Yarrow is a San Francisco high-tech consultant and wine geek
            who runs Vinography, perhaps the Web&rsquo;s most popular and
            comprehensive wine blog. Like many bloggers, he&rsquo;s obsessed
            with what he calls his second career. &ldquo;Instead of watching TV,
            I blog,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I believe telling stories about a
            wine helps remove it from the realm of high status where all we know
            about it is the price.&rdquo; In addition to Yarrow&rsquo;s wine
            writing, Vinography includes his restaurant reviews. For instance,
            he raves about the duck and quince salad, the ravioli--and, yes, the
            wine list-—at Quince in San Francisco. It also features links to
            articles in magazines, newspapers and other blogs.

            Jamie Goode, a Brit, writes for several well-known English wine
            magazines and runs the Wine Anorak website, which offers excellent
            articles about wine travel, winemakers and wine tasting. He saves
            his more casual writing for his blog, in which he&rsquo;s
            refreshingly candid about the daily life of a wine professional.
            &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a huge rise in the number of samples landing
            on the doorstop chez Goode… It&rsquo;s not that there's anything
            wrong with samples; rather, the problem is that you end up focusing
            on a skewed population of wines—-those that people are most anxious
            to flog.&rdquo;

            Madeline Pucketette, Cofounder and Wine Expert on Wine Folly,
            started writing for people who want to know more about wine but they
            don&rsquo;t know where to start. The goal of Wine Folly is to share
            wine knowledge in a way to encourage and inspire new drinkers.

            Dr. Vino, a.k.a. Tyler Colman, really is a doctor—he wrote his
            doctoral dissertation at Northwestern University about the political
            economy of the wine industries in France and the United States.
            After teaching political science for two years, he settled into
            full-time wine writing and education. On his blog--a part of the Dr.
            Vino Web site--Colman intelligently explores the intersection of
            wine, politics and business. For example, he recently explained—-in
            clear, compelling terms—-how the Costco case before the Seattle
            federal district court could lead to an even bigger dismantling of
            the three-tier wine distribution system than the Supreme
            Court&rsquo;s recent decision on interstate shipment of wine.

            The wine and travel columnist for Time magazine, Alice Feiring uses
            her blog to share her thoughts on everything from biodynamic
            winemaking to pairing wild ramps and red Burgundy. In her mission
            statement, she writes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for the Leon
            Trotskys, the Philip Roths, the Chaucers and the Edith Whartons of
            the wine world. I want my wines to tell a good story. I want them
            natural and most of all, like my dear friends, I want them to speak
            the truth even if we argue.&rdquo;

            French photographer Bertrand Celce travels the wine routes of his
            country and records his encounters in both vivid pictures and
            somewhat fractured English with the vignerons he meets along the
            way. For example, Celce profiles Junko Arai, a Japanese wine
            importer who recently began making wine in the Loire, describing her
            efforts to gain appellation status for her bottlings. Celce also
            offers insights on everything from corks to the best Paris wine
            bars­, both legendary and neighborhoody.
